## Project Title: Relative Transfer Function Estimation for Multichannel Signal Processing

### Project Description:
Relative Transfer Function (RTF) describes a linear system that is the ‘difference’ between two linear systems. In the design of array processing algorithms for microphone arrays like Amazon Echo and radio frequency antennas, it is often advantageous to exploit the RTF. However, estimation of RTFs is not straightforward, particularly in time-varying and multi-source scenarios.

This project will outline various techniques for estimating the RTF through simulations. The project may also explore the application of deep neural networks for RTF estimation.
